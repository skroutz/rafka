rafka is a gateway service that exposes Kafka using simple semantics.

It implements a small subset of the [Redis protocol](https://redis.io/topics/protocol),
so that it can be used by leveraging existing Redis client libraries.





Rationale
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Kafka with languages that lack a reliable, solid client library can be a
problem for mission-critical applications.

Using rafka we can:

- Hide Kafka low-level details from the application and provide sane defaults,
  backed by the excellent [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka).
- Use a Redis client instead of a Kafka client. This particularly useful
  in languages that lack a proper Kafka client library or do not provide
  concurrency primitives to implement buffering and other optimizations. Furthermore,
  writing a rafka client is much easier than writing a Kafka client. For a
  list of available client libraries see [_Client libraries_](#client-libraries).

Refer to [*"Introducing Kafka to a Rails application"*](https://engineering.skroutz.gr/blog/kafka-rails-integration/)
for more background and how rafka is used in a production environment.







Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [librdkafka 0.11.0 or later](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka)
- A Kafka cluster



Getting Started
------------

1. Install [librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka):
   ```shell
   # debian
   $ sudo apt-get install librdkafka-dev

   # macOS
   $ brew install librdkafka
   ```
2. Install rafka:
   ```shell
   $ go get -u github.com/skroutz/rafka
   ```
3. Run it:
   ```shell
   $ rafka -c librdkafka.json.sample
   [rafka] 2017/06/26 11:07:23 Spawning Consumer Manager (librdkafka 0.11.0)...
   [server] 2017/06/26 11:07:23 Listening on 0.0.0.0:6380
   ```



Design
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Protocol
rafka exposes a subset of the [Redis protocol](https://redis.io/topics/protocol)
and tries to keep Redis semantics where possible.

We also try to design the protocol in a way that rafka can be
replaced by a plain Redis instance so that it's easier to test client code and
libraries.





### Consumer
In Kafka, each consumer represents a worker processing messages. That worker
sends heartbeats and is de-pooled from its group when it misbehaves.

Those semantics are preserved in rafka by using
_stateful connections_. In rafka, each connection is tied with a set of Kafka
consumers. Consumers are not shared between connections and once the
connection closes, the respective consumers are gracefully shut down too.

Each consumer must identify itself upon connection, by using `client setname
<group.id>:<name>`. Then it can begin processing messages by issuing `blpop`
calls on the desired topics. Each message should be explicitly acknowledged
so it can be committed to Kafka. Acks are `rpush`ed to the special `acks` key.



For more info refer to [API - Consumer](https://github.com/skroutz/rafka#consumer-1).

#### Caveats

rafka periodically calls [`Consumer.StoreOffsets()`](https://docs.confluent.io/current/clients/confluent-kafka-go/index.html#Consumer.StoreOffsets) under the hood. This means consumers must be
configured accordingly:

- `enable.auto.commit` must be set to `true`
- `enable.auto.offset.store` [must](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/v0.11.4/src/rdkafka.h#L2665) be set to `false`

For more info see https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md.

### Producer
Each client connection is tied to a single Producer.

Producers are not shared between connections and once the connection closes, its
producer is also shutdown gracefully.

Producers produce messages using `RPUSHX`.

Produced messages are buffered in rafka and are eventually flushed
to Kafka. However, `DUMP` can be used to force a synchronous flush of any
outstanding messages.


For more info refer to [API - Producer](https://github.com/skroutz/rafka#producer-1).

#### Caveats

There is currently is an upper message limit of **32MB** to the messages that
may be produced. It is controlled by `go-redisproto.MaxBulkSize`.



API
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Producer
- `RPUSHX topics:<topic> <message>` produce a message
- `RPUSHX topics:<topic>:<key> <message>` produce a message with a partition key.
   Messages with the same key will always be assigned to the same partition.
- `DUMP <timeoutMs>` flush any outstanding messages to Kafka. This is a
   blocking operation; it returns until all buffered messages are flushed or
   the timeoutMs exceeds

Example using redis-cli:
```
127.0.0.1:6380> rpushx topics:greetings "hello there!"
"OK"
```





### Consumer
- `CLIENT SETNAME <group.id>:<name>` sets the consumer group and name
- `CLIENT GETNAME`
- `BLPOP topics:<topic>:<JSON-encoded consumer config> <timeoutMs>` consume
   the next message from topic
- `RPUSH acks <topic>:<partition>:<offset>` commit the offset for the given
   topic/partition

Example using redis-cli:
```
127.0.0.1:6380> client setname myapp:a-consumer
"OK"
127.0.0.1:6380> blpop topics:greetings 1000
1) "topic"
2) "greetings"
3) "partition"
4) (integer) 2
5) "offset"
6) (integer) 10
7) "value"
8) "hello there!"
# ... do some work with the greeting...
127.0.0.1:6380> rpush acks greetings:2:10
"OK"
```






### Generic

- [`PING`](https://redis.io/commands/ping)
- [`QUIT`](https://redis.io/commands/quit)
- `HGETALL stats` get monitoring statistics
  monitoring
- `KEYS topics:` list all topics
- `DEL stats` reset the monitoring statistics








Client libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Ruby: [rafka-rb](https://github.com/skroutz/rafka-rb)





Development
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If this is your first time setting up development on rafka, ensure that you
have all the build dependencies via [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep):

```shell
$ dep ensure
```


Running the Go tests:
```shell
$ go test
```

We also have end-to-end tests that run via Docker. Refer
[here](test/README.md) for more information.


Run tests (must have done `make spawn` before), perform various static checks
and finally build the project:
```shell
$ make
```
